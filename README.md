# MirMachine-supplementary

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.]

Supplementary document repository for MirMachine, a command line tool to detect miRNA homologs in genome sequences.


The results folder contains, __MirGeneDB__ species prediction results generated by __MirMachine__ and other species predictions mentioned in the MirMachine manuscript.



We  are using the same directory structure and you will see:
`gff/` __All predicted miRNA families.__  
`filtered_gff/` __High confidence miRNA family predictions after bitscore filtering. (This file is what you need in most cases)__  
`fasta/` __Both high and low confidence predictions in FASTA format.__
